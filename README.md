# Easy Flow üß©

**Easy Flow** is a visual programming platform built with **Next.js** to simplify algorithm creation. With Easy Flow, you can design algorithms using **nodes and edges**, enabling structured and logical workflows without diving into complex code. Unlike drag-and-drop systems, Easy Flow offers a unique mechanism where every new node originates from an existing one. Start creating and connecting, step by step, with ease!
